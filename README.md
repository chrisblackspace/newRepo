    <p>Hi, with the completion of a diploma in business management and the constant development of technology,
      curiosity has been trigged in me non-stop, currently learning Python (programming language) to seek an IT-related career.
      Born and bred in Chile, speaking two languages, Spanish (mother language) and English is second.
      Look at our pets, The puppy’s name is Carlitos, the white cat is Alaska, and the darker one is Topito.</p>

<p style="color: blue;"><b>Interest in IT<b></p>
  <p>Always the curiosity as to how things work has nested deep inside, looking at the stars wondering if one day we will have the technology to discover and see what it is beyond the naked eye. Thanks to great minds, we have achieved a portion of what humanity is capable. As time goes by, new creations and narratives are added to our daily lives.
IT enriches our life just by the fact that, by learning and apply with passion, knowledge, that could suggest and influence people and maybe, create something that will benefit the world we live, could one day be created.
Choosing to come to RMIT was not a difficult option to choose. Searching and enrolling for one of Australia’s most innovative universities is an absolute pleasure for anyone. The challenges this institution will exert are more than welcome, and looking forward to providing a proper delivery when submitting any type of work.
Expectations are equivalent to the effort a person gives to achieve a personal goal. From the very introduction of this course, calls from RMIT are a usual thing, so the support is there. Now, to harness and apply the teaching and help given by RMIT, there will be plenty of questions, some better than others, but remember: There is no dumb question, and they will keep coming. The prospect is to have a better understanding of computers and what we can create.
“IT helps to understand and effectively exercise reasonable, formal, and informal practices in different environments. In most people’s eyes, Information Technology is the present and future, which dramatically excites most people. Technology is resourceful support with infinite opportunities for humanity to build in digital world structures that run and analyse tons of data in mere seconds. My principal interest in IT is building complex structures, giving solutions, and (metaphorically) “create art with knowledge acquired.”

<p style="color: brown;"><i>*Link to Infrastructure and Cloud Architect:</i></p>
<p style="color: brown;">www.seek.com.au/job/53718153?type=standout#searchRequestToken=d8248004-b4c3-4584-b6b4-78e5cf7a3da7</p>
<p>As an infrastructure Cloud Designer, you will be required to complete various tasks and give solutions under specific regulatory bodies in the field. Communication is vital in this area of work. Scope and design the overarching solution also infrastructure design in conjunction with subject matter experts, Project Managers, and Solution and infrastructure design.
It is an ideal job that demands focus and engagement on details when executing the job role. Having a promising career and developing new knowledge is quite attractive; hence this position appeals and invigorates my path in IT.
This role requires specific tertiary qualifications in Information Technology and relevant work experience (it does not mention a time frame for experience), although it demands experience with government job agencies. Also to possess knowledge and solutions of cloud architecture designs that have to be related to; Microsoft SharePoint solutions, Microsoft Dynamics, IT Security, SQL Server, and Reporting Solutions, Azure (PaaS, SaaS, IaaS), and mobility solutions architecting and delivering in conjunction with a range of infrastructure technologies; Oracle databases, SAN, VMWare, Windows OS, MS SQL, Linux, WebLogic, F5. The developing reference architecture, roadmap, policies, and standard patterns.
A well-round understanding of IT and its models is desirable for this role and its high standards.
The proficiency in IT at this stage is primary. Knowing Python, Microsoft Office, G suite, photoshop, confidently managing a computer and its basic settings. Not having experience in software development neither programming, everything I have learned has been through studying in my own time and building small python codes. The more one person practices, the more surprises Information Technology keeps on giving, and that exists any person pursuing a career in the field.
During my studies (roughly three years), a few things will have to be learned to achieve my end goal. Knowledge of an essential and versatile computer language is and how it works, “python,” to make sure I understand what is behind the scenes in the computer world. Get to know at least one operating system Linux, Unix, Solaris, Ubuntu, Windows. Some suggestions, such as learning Linux and some familiarity with the rest of the operating systems. Acquire a good understanding of networking such as TCHP/IP, IP addresses, HTTP, DNS. Security in the cloud is essential, and consequently, a high-level understanding of critical security concepts is a must for a Cloud Architect. So, initial knowledge of some basic security concepts, such as firewalls, is necessary.
RMIT and other institutions will regulate all this knowledge.

<p style="color:blue;">Personality test</p>

<p>These results mean a reassurance of how things are getting done in different aspects of my life. It shows patterns in certain behaviour, also, using this information could determine better results in different types of endeavours and making the strengths stronger than ever before.
Teamwork often requires flexibility and understanding between Team – players. Knowing these results suggests that control in specific aspects should be applied to avoid misunderstanding and direct the strengths to achieve the final goal effectively.
Teams can have a variety of personalities. The fact is that sometimes we do not choose teammates. Therefore, flexibility and understanding is highly desirable. These tests suggest qualities that can be good but also sometimes overwhelming for some people in a group. I would be careful and supportive with any type of approach in relation to group making.
